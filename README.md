# Reasonable Router

A reasonably simple router for React.

# Goals

 * Simple to comprehend and understand
 * Single-pass server side rendering
 * 404 routes
 * Hot reloading that just works

# Non-Goals

 * Component based routing (`<Route ... />`)
 * Asynchronous routes 

# Maybe-Goals

 * Nested 404-routes
 * A controlled router (where i.e. Redux manages the router state completely)
